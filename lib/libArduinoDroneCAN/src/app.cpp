/*
 *   This does everything we need to allow the app to start from the bootloader
 *   If your app is bootloaderless, you don't need this. You'll need to set your program start to 0x08000000 in the linker in ldscript.ld though
 *
 *   Why we need to re-set SCB->VTOR: Arduino's per-family SystemInit()
 *   unconditionally sets VTOR back to FLASH_BASE (0x08000000), which is the
 *   bootloader's vector table when a bootloader is installed. Without
 *   overriding it here, the first interrupt the app handles dispatches
 *   through the bootloader's table -> wrong handler -> crash.
 *
 *   Must match the bootloader-aware ldscript FLASH origin and the bootloader's
 *   APP_START_ADDRESS in BR_bootloader/src/board_config.h.
